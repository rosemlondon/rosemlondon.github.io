This work is the script for a lecture. 

Today I will be discussing this understudied nineteenth-century oil painting,
The Fallen Angel by French Académie painter Alexandre Cabanel. I will be trying to
understand how the work went from a rejected early painting by a forgotten artist to one of the most well-known paintings within internet culture, albeit one
whose fans have little interest in it’s painter, it’s time period or it’s provenance. I
want to use this work as a case study for understanding image authorship in online
‘participatory’ cultures — wherein users are simultaneously media consumers,
contributors, and producers.

In my first lecture, I will use Roland Barthes’s The Death of the Author to ask
whether The Fallen Angel’s internet incarnation is a work with a dead author. In my 1
second lecture, I will critique Barthes by conducting an author-based analysis of the
work, to see if this reveals more answers about the internet reinterpretation. This
structure may seem reversed, but it supports my argument: we must first lay out our
Barthian interpretation before we critique it. Has the online version of The Fallen
Angel lost all connection to its author, or is the author still the driving force behind
this work? I hope my discoveries regarding online ‘collective authorship’ and The
Fallen Angel’s status as a self-portrait convince you that the study of art in online
cultures is a vital area of contemporary art history, as well as questioning The Death of the Author’s reputation for being tedious and overused. As an internet art
historian, I never expected to take such interest in a nineteenth-century academic
artist — my research has spurred an unanticipated fondness for a new genre of art,
and I hope it does the same for you.

The Fallen Angel dates from 1847, during Cabanel’s stay at the Villa Medici
for his Prix de Rome scholarship. The rules dictated that he complete a figure study
in his second year. In my second lecture I will be examining the painting in more
detail, but the work depicts the opening scene from John Milton’s 1667 Paradise
Lost, where fallen rebellious angels lie on the rocky landscape of Hell after losing the
war of heaven. Lucifer, their leader, is pictured. The ‘good’ angels float above him,
diaphanous in Grecian gowns; Lucifer has been punished with nakedness, and he
curls his body away from us, half-hiding his face in shame. However, I think we can
all agree — Cabanel’s treatment of Lucifer is not as defeated. He is vengeful, angry,
and extremely beautiful. Sadly, the jurists did not like the piece, and their remarks
were disparaging — ‘...The movement is wrong, the draughtsmanship imprecise, the
execution deficient...’ And so, The Fallen Angel was forgotten, and this short 2
description exhausts what is often written about it within art history. So much study
needs to be conducted on The Fallen Angel — much more than I have time for
today. In order to get to the heart of this analysis, I will only be addressing the
significance of the author in the work. In my second lecture, I will only be searching
for similarities between Cabanel’s Fallen Angel and its internet incarnation: I will not
be considering it within the wider context of Cabanel’s oeuvre.

Leiden(Shaft)’ (PhD Thesis, University of Jena, 2018), p. 115.


The Fallen Angel begs to be cross-examined, affronting us with its
uncompromising view of masculinity and vast expanse of flesh. I imagine many of
you were prompted by this work to begin thinking about masculinity in academic art,
about images of the devil, perhaps about the nineteenth-century erotic gaze.
However, I did not encounter this work within the context of social art history, or even
within the context of art itself. My encounter with this work was through social media
when in the mid-2010s it became a popular artwork on the internet. This painting
gained a lot of attention in this internet format, severed from any accompanying
information — I do not doubt that many of you recognised it from this
decontextualized state.

The Fallen Angel became firmly entrenched in online image culture. Users
placed Cabanel’s work side-by-side with figures from pop culture, with self-portraits
or lyrics from popular songs. LGBT+ and transgender communities widely shared the
artwork, particularly on the microblogging website Tumblr. For example, here — a
user reflects on the resemblance between Star Wars’s Anakin Skywalker and the
angel, while another uses the work to exemplify a particular personality type, and
another combines the work with song lyrics.

These online new ‘authors’ — authors simply being those who create
meaning in the work — engage with the work’s sense of disobedience,
homoeroticism and effeminate beauty. Its online traction is almost exceptional; I am
sure that no other work has been lifted from obscurity and granted such disparate
social media popularity. Looking at these online responses behind me raises more questions. Perhaps you're thinking — what does this say about conceptualising
masculinity in online communities? However, I believe that in order to begin a
nuanced analysis of images within online culture, we need first to have a method of
understanding how an image changes meaning on the internet. Much of the general
populace's exposure to art is now online.

No doubt many of us in this room experience much of our art on the internet. These artworks are often isolated, with
no caption or background information, presented alongside art from other artists,
societies and cultures. This state makes online imagery vulnerable to authorship
critique.

When I first began looking at online reinterpretations of The Fallen Angel, I
tried to find something they all shared. I realised that many responses share a
disregard for the authority of the original author, Cabanel — the work is severed from
its original context, manipulated for internet users’ own ends. This led me to critically
revisit Barthes’s The Death of the Author. The text is a classic in literary theory,
wherein Barthes argues for a new type of writing, unanchored to an author. Cabanel
is particularly susceptible to authorship critique due to his position outside the canon:
even if his name accompanies his work, there is little chance a reader will recognise
him.
We have to be critically self-conscious when working with The Death of the
Author. We must be careful not to over-rely on the text as a source of authority,
rather as an experimental methodology to help understand The Fallen Angel within

internet image culture. Further to this, not only was the text written three decades
before the internet’s arrival, but within the context of a specific 1960s French literary
culture that was heavily male, and heavily exclusive — Barthes only references
Honoré de Balzac and Stéphane Mallarmé, making it clear his dying author is
certainly a male one. On the contrary, social media is dominated by women and 4
marginalised identities, who are often both the audience and the author. This 5
undoubtedly adds a complicating dimension.
In order to mitigate these complications, I will be referencing a text entitled
Improbable Curators: Analysing Nostalgia, Authorship and Audience on Tumblr
Microblogs by Dinu Gabriel Munteanu. It is through Munteanu that I became 6
fascinated with a Barthian approach to internet image culture — he believes that
images within the complex intrapersonal image nexus of Tumblr blogging ‘become
‘language’, ‘discourse’, and ‘speech’, thus entering the analytical province of
semiology.’ Munteanu is a communication theorist working with digital identity, and 7
Improbable Curators focuses on the transference of images around an online
demographic he refers to as ‘young nostalgics’, those who interact with visual
content with a view towards the past. In his words, they are content-collectors with
‘oneiric air of ambiguity, of interpenetrated psycho-symbolic accents - stressing the

feminine here, the mystical there, the childish or the tragic a few images lower’. I 8
chose to use Improbable Curators alongside Barthes as it offers interviews with
these ‘new authors’ — the bloggers, the Instagram pages, the commenters, the
people who are anonymously interacting with images much like The Fallen Angel. By
supplementing Barthes’s theory on authorship with Munteanu’s first-hand analysis of
internet culture, I hope to make my methodology applicable to the online world.
While Barthes was writing for a different time, close reading of The Death of
the Author reveals he prefigured internet decontextualisation of imagery. The text
begins with an excerpt from Balzac, from which he questions — who is speaking in
this piece of fiction? He invalidates explanations for literary works sought in the
author who produced it, and states that literature is ‘tyrannically centred on the
author, his person’. The ‘new authors’ interacting with The Fallen Angel have no 9
consideration of a ‘tyrannical author’; often this image is posted without any text
assigning Cabanel as the painter. For internet users, Cabanel is not significant to
their enjoyment of the work.

For example, here, this post with 1,900 ‘notes’ or interactions, where the
image is accompanied by a short fictional caption written by the ‘new author’
themselves, who feels no need to give authority to Cabanel. Images I found of The
Fallen Angel were often re-representations in themselves — the ‘original’ becomes
so lost that it ceases to exist. Much visual material on Tumblr is what Munteanu calls   ‘free-floating’, living parallel lives to many other instances of the same image, with no
designation of origin.
It seems that Barthes’s description of reader-driven authorship fits the
internet, and Munteanu agrees with this online subversion of the author figure. When
discussing what he calls the ‘vicarious curatorial visions’ of Tumblr users, he
describes how the ‘young nostalgics’ ’destabilise the three conventional ‘sites’ of an
image (‘production’ ‘image’ ‘audience’) but also raise interesting questions with
regard to individual agency’ — that is, the agency of the blogger and their role in the
image production.

This concept of destabilised authorship is mirrored in Barthes’s projection that
after the death of the author, ‘every text is eternally written here and now’, and a text
is ‘a multi-dimensional space in which a variety of writings, none of them original,
blend and clash. The text is a tissue of quotations drawn from the innumerable
centres of culture’. This is the heart of Barthes’s text, and is vital to understanding 12
how The Fallen Angel has changed. The work has become a ‘tissue of quotations’
drawn from ‘innumerable centres of culture’. Going back to the raw instances of this
work gaining traction on the internet,

we have meaning being created through elements of culture such as Star
Wars, Korean singers, the beauty industry, through densely intrapersonal LGBT+
cultures. This slide is only a fraction of responses you can find online. And this

meaning is constantly being written — ‘eternally being written’ — by constant
recycling through participatory communities. I can try and track some of this
reception, but it seems every online ‘new author’ creates their own meaning. In
Improbable Curators’s interviews with Tumblr bloggers, the ‘new authors’ themselves
are aware of their semiotic manipulation of imagery. A blogger called Marie states
‘Yes, the photograph takes on a life of its own. It's interesting ... it loses its meaning
and gains another meaning.’ Again, the new authors do not find original authors 13
significant to their use of imagery.
But, how is this different from a nineteenth-century viewer interpreting The
Fallen Angel? If you believe another of Barthes’s text, The Rhetoric of Image, every
viewer brings their own ‘lexia’ to an image, and comes away with a slightly different
meaning. And yes, disparate reinterpretations of images have always occurred, but 14
through the internet, all restrictions on this ‘tissue of quotations’ is stripped away.
The internet allows no restriction of interpretation. Make yourself the author, make
George Lucas the author, make musicians or celebrities the work. It is all equally as
valid on the sphere of the internet as the original interpretation by Alexandre Cabanel
— very often, posted reinterpretations gain more popularity.
S11
As you can see, the comparison with Anakin Skywalker seems to have gained
visible authority across the internet. There are undoubtedly many people who now
associate Star Wars and The Fallen Angel without question. Barthes’s prediction has
come true — ‘every text is eternally written here and now’. As we continue to read

Barthes’s text, his next paragraph became instrumental for considering the role of
me, us, the art historian, in looking at this image through the lens of the internet.
S12
(Read out full quotation) ‘In the multiplicity of writing, everything is to be
disentangled, nothing deciphered.’ If we abide by the application of Barthes’s 15
methodology to internet images, he affirms that the role of the art historian, when
faced with an authorless artwork like the online interpretation of The Fallen Angel,
ceases to exist; to draw conclusions about its meaning would be to ‘impose a limit’
on this work. Hence why I believe this methodological analysis needs to be done
before we draw conclusions about the work — before we draw conclusions about
masculinity in online communities, as I brought up in my introduction.
Barthes’s analysis fits how The Fallen Angel has changed; the image has
become a ‘tissue of quotations’, and now ‘everything is to be disentangled, nothing
deciphered’. However, I would venture to say The Fallen Angel’s authorless state is
far beyond what Barthes hypothesised. ‘New authors’ form a sort of collective
authorship of the image; each informing each other, some gaining authority, some
simply adding to the intertextuality of the image. Cabanel’s voice is lost in this work
— but some reanimate him,
S11
as on the left here, which Barthes does not account for. Some manipulate his
voice and cast themselves in his place. In the modern age, Barthes’s dead
authorship becomes a far more complicated web — this has begun to be explored by
Munteanu with his ‘free-floating’ approach to image transference by ‘young

nostalgics’, however, it needs more analysis. Barthes’s The Death of the Author
serves well to address how meaning changes in art on the internet, but does not
adequately prefigure the truly complicated nature of online authorship.
I have stated that The Fallen Angel’s meaning has changed, and it seems
visible enough looking at the internet reinterpretations; we are looking at a work
different in meaning from the one presented to the Paris salon in 1847. However, in
order to state this, I must be confident with the original meaning of Alexandre
Cabanel’s The Fallen Angel. We must trace back our argument and give credence to
what Barthes so vehemently disparaged — that the ‘image of literature to be found in
ordinary culture is tyrannically centred on the author, his person’. We must take a
critical stance against Barthes, and ask — were any of these elements that ‘new
authors’ are reacting to present all along?

Text 2: Deciphering The Fallen Angel
S13
In the first lecture, I hypothesised that The Fallen Angel’s popularity on the
internet has rendered it an example of Barthes’s The Death of the Author —
although more theoretical analysis needs to be done to find an appropriate method
of understanding authorship on the internet. I claimed themes of disobedience,
homoeroticism and gender criticism in online responses were disconnected from the
original author. The Fallen Angel has become ‘a multi-dimensional space in which a
variety of writings, none of them original, blend and clash.’ But to state this we need
a confident understanding of the artwork itself. In this second lecture, I will
investigate the intent behind Cabanel’s work from the culture and society from which

11

it was produced, and from available primary sources. To oppose Barthes, I asked —
were any of the reinterpreted ideas present in the original fabric of the work? The
Fallen Angel’s context in humanist issues of fall and redemption, in personal
projection onto religious narratives and Cabanel’s psychological suffering will
complicate our use of Barthes’s text. Cabanel may be more significant to online ‘new
authors’ than we first thought.
Little has been written about Cabanel at all, bar the French Alexandre
Cabanel: La Tradition du Beau, published in 2011 with the retrospective of his work
at the Musée Fabre, and its abridged English translation, The Tradition of Beauty.
These publications were a bid to rediscover Cabanel — sadly, they did not succeed.
Cabanel’s letters will be hugely important for this biographical analysis, as are
studies on Satan in nineteenth-century French culture; I will use Emily Walker’s
thesis ‘Prince of Darkness, Light Bearer: An Exploration of Representations of the
Devil as a Fallen Angel in Nineteenth-Century France’ throughout this lecture. First 16
we must know more about our author, Alexandre Cabanel. Born in 1823 and dying in
1889, Cabanel was Napoleon III’s preferred official painter. Andreas Blühm in The
Tradition of Beauty states Cabanel was ‘one of the outstanding personalities of the
Second Empire’, and that ‘Cabanel epitomises academic painting in the same way
that Delacroix stands for romanticism and Courbet for realism’. Yet, there has been 17
only one major retrospective of his work. Why is he so unstudied? It may partly be
due to his reputation for L’Art Pompier — a derogatory term for the dramatic,

Diable en tant qu'ange déchu en France au XIXe siècle’ (The University of Victoria, Masters’ thesis,
2013).

exorbitant, over-the-top allegorical and historical works that dominated the Salon
during Cabanel’s time.
S14
Nonetheless, he won the Prix de Rome in 1845 with his Mocking of Christ, in
1852 he won a second class medal for his Velleda, later winning a First Class Medal
and Knights Cross Legion of Honour for The Death of Moses. By the beginning of 18
the 1860s, his place in the Paris art scene seemed secure; he was the only one
thought capable of picking up the mantle after Ingre’s death in 1867.19
However, this was a period of transition, where the general hierarchy of art
established by the Académie was eroding as modernism was nascent. Most of all,
Cabanel was unlucky. Much of his work was shipped to America and hidden in
private collections. Much, too, was destroyed in World War II. Even with his success,
Cabanel seemed to suffer an equal amount of failure: in subsequent Salons, he
could not live up to his previous work. Critic Maxime du Camp said of Cabanel — ‘we
had reason to expect more, or anything better, from Monsieur Cabanel - the promise
shown in Death of Moses is still waiting to be fulfilled’. Jules-Antoine Castagnary 20
said that ‘In his efforts to be part of the elegant, grand world, this poet, laden down
with his medals, absolutely suppresses life’. None of these works behind me have 21
achieved The Fallen Angel’s popularity online: in fact, I would be surprised if any of
you even recognise these pieces. There must be something particular about The
Fallen Angel.

S15
Let us start to unravel the story of this work with the basics. In terms of
content, Paradise Lost was not an unusual topic for painters of this time, with Sir
Thomas Lawrence and Gustave Doré also illustrating Milton’s Lucifer. The Fallen
Angel is a strikingly accurate portrayal of Milton’s text; from Book 1, Lucifer is
described as —
S16
(Read out full quotation) ‘Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast, Signs of
remorse and passion....’ Cabanel’s Lucifer is Milton’s Lucifer; he has captured the 22
‘cruel’ eyes with ‘remorse and passion’ perfectly. But this painting goes beyond
Milton’s text.
S17
His treatment of Lucifer is part of a wider European artistic disposition Emily
Walker identified as a humanist compassion for the figure of Lucifer — ‘Not the
bestial Devil, but the angel fallen into the human body.’ On the screen, we have 23
Joseph Geef’s L’Ange du Mal, 1848, Constantino Corti’s Lucifero, 1867, and
Jean-Jacques Feuchère's Satan, which caused a sensation at the Salon in 1834.24
All within decades of Cabanel’s Lucifer, all experimenting with this alluring,
masculine, very human diabolism. From the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries, the
Devil was often represented as a cloven-hooved horned beast, and particularly
Geef’s and Feuchère's works maintain a level of bestiality with their sinewy mandorla

of bat wings. But The Fallen Angel stands out from its contemporaries by its 25
complete humanism. Is this a vital aspect of the internet’s engagement with the
work? After all, users seem especially interested in Lucifer's beauty.
S18
This top row comparison of the work with a Korean music star compares the
angel’s beauty with the musician's beauty, and just below, this makeup artist
recreates Lucifer’s particular form of effeminate attractiveness.
S19
Another striking element of Cabanel’s angel is that he is alone. He faces away
from the ‘good’ angels, who pale in comparison to his body. Lucifer’s body is a show
of skill; the musculature, the arms lifting to show the lightly defined serratus anterior,
the tension in the arm from the clasping hands, the raised hamstring tendons and
tensed calf... I was particularly amazed by the blue tones under the skin. It would be
easy to suggest the online ‘new authors’ are purely engaging with this salacious
display of masculinity, rather than any particularities of the art. But why this work,
among hundreds similar?
Answering this question requires two key primary resources on The Fallen
Angel. The first is an 1847 letter from Cabanel to Alfred Bruyas, an art collector and
personal friend. The second is a preparatory oil sketch. Studying these two
resources led me to consider that The Fallen Angel is much more than an academic
figure study. The work is a psychological self-portrait of its author, capturing an
ahistorical angst of redemption that chimes with the adolescent audience of the
internet. If this is true, there is a continuity between Cabanel and ‘new authors’.

25 Demetrio Paparoni, The Art of the Devil (Los Angeles, 2019).

S20
We will first look at the letter, which describes The Fallen Angel at length. I
have put the whole text on the slide so you can get a sense of the structure. Cabanel
recounts that his work will be ‘interesting as a subject and for my reasons for
execution’ — he had exceptional intentions for this work, rather than a traditional
figure study. With regards to the subject matter, the description differs from the final 26
work. He states ‘I stage two natures, two races, one ... finally to fall; while the other
chaste and pure rises radiantly towards God...’ He describes the main motive of the
work as ‘the genius of evil, Satan! ... today broken power lowers his head ... he hides
the shame of his defeat.’ This letter implies the ‘chaste and pure’ angels are the 27
protagonists of the work, but in the final piece they are merely background to the
beauty of Lucifer, whom he describes with a ‘lowered head’ as ‘broken’. Would you
agree this is a broken figure? What happened between this letter’s fairly traditional
narrative of good triumphing over broken evil, and the final work’s indulgence in
diabolic beauty?
S21
The letter combined with this 1846 preparatory sketch allows us to see a
conceptual struggle in The Fallen Angel. I think we can all agree, this sketch gives
an entirely different emotional effect from the final work. Here we have them both,

26 Alexandre Cabanel, letter to Alfred Bruyas, 27th September 1847, quoted by Gabriel Negraschus in
‘Der Schone Satan in der Skulptur Des 19. Jahrhunderts: Ein Genius Der Leiden(Shaft)’ (PhD Thesis,
University of Jena, 2018), p. 148.
27 Original French: ‘Je mets en scène deux natures, deux races, l’une inexorablement vouée,
prédestinée au mal et au malheur, enfin à tomber ; tandis que l’autre chaste et pure s’élève
radieusement vers Dieu en le glorifiant. Or, le principal motif de mon tableau est le génie du mal,
Satan ! sur qui jadis, Dieu s’était complu à répandre les grâces de la beauté divine ; aujourd’hui
puissance brisée courbant la tête devant son créateur et maître, de qui il avait osé se faire rival. Il
cache la honte de sa défaite cependant...’.

16

side by side.
S22
In the sketch, we see Cabanel’s ‘broken’ Lucifer, who has suffered the fall
greatly. He is humiliated, ashamed and in pain. But again, this is not the work
described in the letter — the fellow angels are gone, the figure is completely alone.
This seems less a sketch for depicting a religious narrative, more a portrait of
torment. The sky is clouded, and the figure has shrunk, his head and torso hunched
and turned away from us. His posture is almost identical in both works; but by
removing the focal point of the final piece — those eyes, the hair, the pinched
eyebrows — the emotional effect is entirely changed. Through this sketch we can
see that Cabanel was toying with contradictory concepts: the defeated Lucifer and
triumphant angels, the shame of the fall, the proud figure of redemption. The only
trace of the suffering of the sketch in the final work -
S23
is in the eyes, the very vector around which internet reactions pivot. Cabanel’s
choice of emotional intensity coupled with redemption is significant for internet users.
But why did he change the work’s narrative so drastically? Gabriel Negraschus in
‘The Beautiful Satan in Nineteenth-century Sculpture’ suggests The Fallen Angel
‘was a work with which he [Cabanel] identified himself ... He wanted to prove himself
as an original painter, and that very fact was his rebellion.’ Cabanel may have been 28
self-identifying with his Fallen Angel, and in turn, internet users are doing the same.
This may seem unusual, but self-identification with the devil was common in

28 Original German: ’Als Cabanel selbst noch angehender Maler war, stellte der Ange déchu ein Werk
dar, mit dem er sich identifizierte und was tatsächlich an seine damalige Situation als Künstler
gekoppelt war. Er wollte sich als besonders origineller Maler beweisen, wobei eben jener Umstand
seine Rebellion darstellen.’ Negraschus, ‘Der Schone Satan’, p. 149.

17

nineteenth-century France, as the story of Satan explored the critical questions of
post-Enlightenment human existence, from the origins of the universe, the state of
the soul, and the state of humanity.29
S24
To pursue this concept, I revisited Cabanel’s letters. Close reading reveals
Cabanel’s years in Rome as unhappy, isolated, and devoted to art. On this slide, I
have put just a few psychologically poignant excerpts. In a letter to Bruyas regarding
his habits in Rome, he explains ‘I have been leading a rather orderly life, one
completely devoted to art. I have remained as untouched, as pure as Rome’s vestal
virgins of days gone by ... What’s more, I am weary of chasing after happiness that
turns out to be an illusion, what’s the use?’ His devotion to art seems more of a 30
curse than a blessing; in an 1849 letter he states ‘I hope this crazy ambition does not
upset you too much. You should rather feel sorry for me: This is the fell swoop that
will destroy my existence’. There is something of a certain depression in his letters, 31
too — to Bruyas, he said ‘Several times an evening, I have put details from my
present life on paper so as to send them to you in letters. On re-reading them,
however, even I found them so joyless and full of sorrow that I burned them...’32
Cabanel was 23 when he painted The Fallen Angel, and had already been
subject to quite a few difficulties in life. The Mocking of Christ was only awarded

second place, and Cabanel’s Prix de Rome scholarship had to be argued for by the
Secretary to the Académie — he was eventually awarded a ‘Second First Grand
Prize’. One can imagine this may have been a difficult, humiliating experience. In 33
general, being an artist at this time was not easy: from childhood, the sacrifices
Cabanel would have had to make to achieve such skill would have been immense.
Success was for the few, failure meant obscurity, and quite possibly ruin.34
While Negraschus believes Cabanel’s self-identification with The Fallen Angel
centres on a rebellion against the strictures of the Salon, I believe he identified with
Lucifer’s story of fall and redemption. The Fallen Angel’s unusual humanism, it’s
tormented early sketches and the shockingly intense facial expression begin to take
shape as a self-portrait.
This thread of analysis led me to consider Cabanel’s more official self
portraits.
S25
His early portraits are unremarkable, showing a young man, professional and
earnest. But just a few years after Cabanel had painted The Fallen Angel, this is the
kind of self-portrait he was producing.
S26
His portraits increasingly have something of the gothic about them. Here he is
27, in 1849. The obscuring chiaroscuro on his face, the tousled hair, the set mouth
and pinched eyebrows become a recurring feature in his self-portraits, a recurring
feature that seems familiar...

S27
Not only does Cabanel’s Lucifer look facially similar to Cabanel himself — in
his 1851 portrait, his hair is even red — but emotionally similar. There is a
concealment, a duality of vulnerability and cold masculinity. His expression is a
subtle reflection of Lucifer’s, tragic yet strong. Not only did Cabanel reflect his own
emotional state in his Fallen Angel, he actively painted his own face.
It is difficult to say this for certain, of course. Artists often naturally reproduce
their own features, and his letters only give us a brief glimpse into his character.
However, in the empty field of study for this artwork, I believe it to be a fair proposal
— and if this is the case, Cabanel’s presence is crucial to the online ‘new authors’ of
the work.
S28
They mirror this desire to self-aggrandise and self-mythologise in the face of
difficulty. When comparing The Fallen Angel with the popular culture figure of Anakin
Skywalker, or by painting their faces to look like him — are they not desiring to
project themselves or others into this figure of redemption? Here on the right, where
once we saw disregard for an author, this earlier user’s emotional intimacy with the
work — ‘you were so misunderstood, torn down’ — seems eerily connected to the
figure of Cabanel.
While this work still evades clear conclusions, it appears these ‘new authors’
are not as detached from the original author as we thought in our first lecture. The
‘tyrannical’ figure of the author is very much still present in the work, however,
something has changed about the authorship of the image in line with Barthes’s text.
The Death of the Author gave us a good foundational approach to this artwork’s

20

online existence, but ultimately fell short of the diversity of engagement between
authorship and audience. I enjoy Munteanu’s term of ‘free-floating’, and I believe
total freedom of image transfer has resulted in a ‘free-floating’ ‘collective authorship’.
The idea of defeat and redemption coupled with the beautiful emotionalism struck a
chord with online audiences, allowing a renaissance art historians could never have
predicted.
To conclude, I would like to go back to this quote from The Death of the
Author, regarding the role of the art historian.
S29
My study of image authorship in participatory cultures has definitely been a
case of ‘disentangling’ rather than ‘deciphering’, and I do believe trying to fully
understand the disparate online reinterpretations of The Fallen Angel would be to
‘impose a limit’ on the work. I also have no desire to ‘close’ this lecture with a quick
and simple conclusion of what both The Fallen Angel and it’s online reinterpretations
mean for each other. However, I will conclude that many of the themes internet
interpreters were engaging with were present in Cabanel while he was producing this
work, and that more theory in line with Munteanu’s analysis of authorship on Tumblr
would make Barthes’s ideas more applicable to the internet age.
Furthermore, contrary to Barthes’s quote behind me, and the idea that this
renders the role of the art historian useless: The Fallen Angel’s online life catalysed
my biographical analysis, leading me to discover new things about both Cabanel and
this forgotten work of art. It is clear the modern reaction to The Fallen Angel is just as
important as its traditional interpretation, and this cannot be excluded from the
artwork’s life story without rendering it an incomplete story.

21

All of us are ‘internet art historians’ in this modern age. I think many of us are
aware that traditional art-historical methodology is simply incompatible with the
method of image viewing borne from the internet. We are going to have to start
acknowledging that the way of seeing through the internet is entirely different. I hope
that not only do you go away with an appreciation for Alexandre Cabanel’s forgotten
works, but in the future, you critically engage with your favourite paintings’ online
lives, and take that modern audience’s participation in the art world seriously.
