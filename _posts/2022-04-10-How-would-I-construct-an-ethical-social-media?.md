How would I construct an ethical social media?

1. Decentralised ownership, no shareholder pressure.
2. Health-centric user interface - reduction in colour hyperintensity, integrated blue-light removal, scrolling feature replaced by page-turning, algorithm organically sorted, audio posts discouraged, automatic notification silencing in unsociable hours.
3. Push for global userbase, accessible on non-modern devices / low data speeds.
4. Merit-based promotion methods, no financial in-app purchase options to increase reach.
5. Regular discovery pathways to offset radicalisation and to prevent influencer oligarchies.
6. Meta-style oversight board / Supreme Court to critically engage with censorship decisions.
7. Company directors must be from creative sector.
8. Number-decentralised metrics (perhaps moving towards a model similar to Tik-Tok or 2009 Youtube - long responses prioritised over views, likes etc).
9. Carbon zero data banks.
10. Integrated non-technology motivations in-app, calls for adventure, such as - app will not function until user takes a photo of the first bird they can find.
11. Borderless hiring.
12. Forest office for staff - outdoor meetings and workspaces encouraged.
13. Zero on-platform advertising - funding supplied by global network of mushroom farms.
14. Excess funds sponsor rewilding projects voted for by users.
15. All physical in-company correspondence is seed paper.
16. Craft classes for staff after work, free of charge.
17. Marketplace adjoined to social media for moneyless trading of goods and services. 
18. Artists and community activists in local area flagged to users.
19. Toggle option for dance breaks.
20. Grassroots company manfiesto updated yearly on what we want for the future of humanity & technology, co-written by all users.
